Installing the library
======================

Install
-------
To install the library from `Pypi <https://pypi.org/project/rpi-rfm69/>`_:

.. code::

    pip3 install rpi-rfm69

.. note::
    The library is dependant on "spidev" and "RPI.GPIO" and therefore will only install correctly on a Raspberry Pi. Also, since Python 2 is EOL only Python 3 is supported.
