   This project is a Beta release and as such it may contain bugs. If you spot one then please report it as an `issue on Github <https://github.com/jgillula/rpi-rfm69/issues>`_. We want to make this project awesome and to do that we need your help!


Welcome to RFM69Radio's documentation!
======================================
This package provides a Python wrapper of the `LowPowerLabs RFM69 library <https://github.com/LowPowerLab/RFM69>`_ and is largely based on the work of `Eric Trombly <https://github.com/etrombly/RFM69>`_ who ported the library from C.

The package expects to be installed on a Raspberry Pi and depends on the `RPI.GPIO <https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/>`_ and `spidev <https://pypi.org/project/spidev/>`_ libraries. In addition you need to have an RFM69 radio module directly attached to the Pi. For details on how to connect such a module checkout this guide :doc:`hookup`.
